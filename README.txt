# PC Gamer Scraper

This project is a web scraper developed in Python to monitor and collect prices of computer components (CPU, GPU, Motherboard, etc.) from major Brazilian e-commerce sites, such as Kabum!, Pichau, and TerabyteShop.

## ‚ú® Core Features

- **Multiple Sources**: Collects data from over 10 major online retailers.
- **Efficient Scraping**: Uses `requests` for lightweight and fast collection, focusing on search pages to minimize server load and costs.
- **Dual-Frequency Strategy**:
    - Scans the first few pages every 5 minutes to capture sales and "hot" items.
    - Performs a full daily scan across all categories of interest.
- **Data Validation**: Employs `Selenium` in a daily test to ensure the integrity of the data collected via `requests`.
- **Modular Architecture**: Designed with Object-Oriented principles for easy maintenance and expansion.
